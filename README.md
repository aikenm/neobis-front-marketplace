## Features

- **Login Page:**

  The Login Page greets users with a refined interface, centralizing its focus on ease of access. There are two primary input fields: one for the user's login credentials and the other for the password. For enhanced security during typing, a toggle password visibility button is provided, allowing users to either mask or display their passwords as they deem necessary. Below the main login fields, there's a handy link directing users who don't have an account to the signup page, ensuring seamless navigation within the platform.

- **Signup Page:**

  Signup Page offers an intuitive registration process. Upon landing, users are met with four distinct input fields: an email field for account correspondence, a login field to set their unique username, a password field for security, and a subsequent password confirmation field to ensure accuracy. The design prioritizes clarity, guiding new users through each step towards creating their Lordby account efficiently.

- **Strong password criterias:**

  To ensure user account security, Lordby enforces stringent password guidelines. Users are prompted to create a password that adheres to the following criteria:

  1. Length: Between 8 to 15 characters.
  2. Character Diversity: Must include both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  3. Numerical Inclusion: At least one numerical digit is mandatory.
  4. Special Characters: Incorporate a minimum of one special character (e.g., !, ", #, $...).

  These measures are meticulously designed to fortify account protection and safeguard user information.

- **Confirmation Page:**

  Confirmation Page assures users of their successful registration step. Immediately noticeable is a prominently displayed message informing them that a confirmation link has been dispatched to their registered email. To accommodate potential email delivery issues, a user-friendly option is available in the form of a button, allowing for the easy resending of the confirmation link, ensuring every user can seamlessly complete their registration journey.

- **Profile Page:**

  Upon successful email confirmation, users are gracefully welcomed to the Profile Page, marking the completion of their registration process. The profile page stands as a testament to their successful integration into the Lordby community. Additionally, for those wishing to safely exit their session, a convenient log-out button is prominently positioned, ensuring ease of access. Once logged out, users are seamlessly redirected back to the login page, allowing for re-entry when they desire.
